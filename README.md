# Learn Ansible

##### All the stored password in this repository is not important. So, isn't a big problem if I pushed a password, vault file, and SSH Key. Also, I've been written wiki pages for this repo. It will be used for the tutorial.

You can read the wiki [here](https://github.com/mataberat/learn-ansible/wiki).
